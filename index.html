    <h1>&hellip;what? Oh! Hello.</h1>
    <p>Well, this is a tad awkward. If I&rsquo;d known you were coming I would
    have prepared something&hellip; but alas there&rsquo;s nothing interesting
    here (yet?). Sorry. I guess that&rsquo;s what you get, wandering around on
    strange domains you don&rsquo;t belong on. Y&rsquo;know. You get
    <em>disappointment</em>.
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>You want to know about me? Goodness. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;
    <p>I live in Sydney, Australia, where I moved having grown up in the nearby
    Blue Mountains.
    <p>For <code>$WORK</code> at the moment I&rsquo;m an Engineer at <a href="https://snowplow.io/">Snowplow Australia</a>. The product is pretty neat, check it out. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/poplindata/chrome-snowplow-inspector">this web extension</a> which might be useful if you use it, too. Week-to-week work typically involves:
    <ul>
      <li>building and maintaining data pipelines in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (not just Snowplow-related)
      <li>a bunch of <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> analysis and <abbr title="Data Base Administrator">DBA</abbr>-ish stuff (mostly <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Redshift</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>, and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>, with smatterings of regular <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I have also worked with the Oracle and Microsoft solutions, but do not not want to again.)
      <li>front-end Tag Management (usually/preferably with <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a>) with ECMAScript (and I dabble in some front-end dev with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, too)
      <li>cloud faff (mostly <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr></a>, but increasingly also <a href="https://cloud.google.com/"><abbr title="Google Cloud Platform">GCP</abbr></a>)
      <li>some general ops stuff, including a bit of system administration and sometime even IT support around the office (although I managed to get the printer working on everyone&rsquo;s machine but my own somehow?)
      <li>helping man the support desk and liase with clients
      </ul>
    <p>I enjoy solving problems, the more puzzling the better, so like diversity in my roles where I get exposed to lots of moving parts. I am open to opportunities if the problems are interesting enough.
    <p>Then at home I like playing with more niche technologies than I get to work with. Right now I&rsquo;m excited about:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64 hardware</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/">J</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>
      <li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
      </ul>
    <p>Outside of work I often help organise the Sydney chapters of <a href="https://www.dawsydney.org.au/">Data &amp; Analytics Wednesday</a> and <a href="https://sydney.measurecamp.org/">MeasureCamp</a>, which are both free and you should come attend!
    <p>I like other stuff too (in no particular order): both kinds of games (board <em>and</em> video), music, politics, cooking, gardening, beer, wine, spirits, arguing, cats, combinations of these things.
    <p>I care a lot about (in no particular order): equality, education, software freedom, the internet, the web, accessibility, privacy (ironically), perf, Pok&eacute;mon, family, freedom of expression, mental health, software monocultures.
    <p>I would love to learn (in no particular order): beekeeping, drawing, keyboard, sewing, guitar, Scheme, driving, more math, beer brewing, carpentry, automechanics, teaching, electronics.
    <p>If you want to reach out and/or chat feel free to <a href="mailto:jethro@thisdomain">email me</a> or hit me up on the socials below (I am not on Facebook/Twitter/etc).
